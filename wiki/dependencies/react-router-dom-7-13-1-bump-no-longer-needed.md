# react-router-dom 7.13.1 bump no longer needed

A Dependabot pull request was opened to update **react-router-dom** from version `7.13.0` to `7.13.1` in the *react* group.

## Original intent
- Update `react-router-dom` to `7.13.1`.
- Corresponding changelog entry indicated a patch change that only updated the `react-router` dependency.

## Current status
The Dependabot bot later commented:
> "Looks like react-router-dom is updatable in another way, so this is no longer needed."

Because the package can be upgraded through an alternative workflow, the PR is no longer required and should be closed.

## Action required
- Close the Dependabot PR.
- Ensure any alternative update method is applied as needed.

*This document records the decision for future reference.*
