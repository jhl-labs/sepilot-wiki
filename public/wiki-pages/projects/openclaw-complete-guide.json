While the platform is flexible, the choice of hardware has a direct impact on reliability, uptime, and scalability.\n\n---\n\n## Hardware Compatibility\n\nOpenClaw can be run on any modern server‑class machine that meets the following baseline requirements:\n\n- **CPU**: 4‑core x86_64 (or Apple Silicon M‑series with Rosetta 2 support) ≥ 2 GHz.\n- **Memory**: Minimum 8 GB RAM; 16 GB+ recommended for multiple concurrent Claws.\n- **Storage**: SSD with at least 50 GB free space for logs, container images, and persistent state.\n- **Network**: Stable broadband connection with inbound ports open for webhooks (typically 443/80) and outbound internet access for API calls.\n- **OS**: Linux (Ubuntu 22.04 LTS, Debian 12, etc.) or macOS 12+ for development environments.\n\nThese specifications are derived from the general guidance in the OpenClaw community and are corroborated by the accessory and workstation guides for the Mac Mini [OpenClaw Mac Mini Developer Workstation Specs](https://openclawn.com/openclaw-mac-mini-developer-workstation-specs/) and the hardware‑software integration article [Seamless Synergy: OpenClaw Mac Mini Hardware‑Software Integration](https://openclawn.com/openclaw-mac-mini-hardware-software-integration/).\n\n---\n\n## Mac Mini Limitations\n\nWhile a Mac Mini is an attractive, low‑cost form factor, several practical constraints make it a **sub‑optimal choice for production‑grade OpenClaw deployments**:\n\n1. **Uptime Risks** – Home‑grade power and macOS automatic updates can cause unexpected reboots, breaking the “always‑on” guarantee of a Claw.\n2. **Networking Complexity** – Residential routers often require manual port‑forwarding, dynamic DNS, and TLS certificate management to expose webhook endpoints.\n3. **Security Surface** – Running privileged agents on a personal workstation exposes the entire LAN to potential compromise if a Claw is mis‑configured.\n4. **Scalability Limits** – A single Mac Mini has limited CPU/Memory headroom; scaling to multiple Claws or heavier workloads quickly exhausts resources.\n5. **Process Supervision** – macOS lacks built‑in process supervisors comparable to Linux systemd or Elixir OTP, requiring custom scripts to auto‑restart crashed agents.\n\nThese points echo the observations from Andrej Karpathy’s Mac Mini experiment, which highlighted power‑outage susceptibility, networking hurdles, and the need for external supervision [OpenClaw Mac Mini as a Developer Workstation: Specs for …](https://openclawn.com/openclaw-mac-mini-developer-workstation-specs/).\n\n**Recommendation** – For production or long‑running Claw deployments, prefer a cloud‑hosted or dedicated server environment (e.g., Fly.io, VPS) that provides robust supervision, automatic restarts, and reliable networking.\n\n---\n\n## Claw Variant Recommendations\n\nOpenClaw offers several variants, each tuned for different trade‑offs:\n\n| Variant | Approx. Code Size | Typical Use‑Case | Key Trade‑offs |\n|---------|-------------------|------------------|---------------|\n| **OpenClaw** | Full feature set | General‑purpose, multi‑agent orchestration | Higher resource consumption |\n| **NanoClaw** | ~4 000 LOC | Lightweight, single‑agent workloads; easy to audit | Limited built‑in tools |\n| **zeroclaw** | Minimal core | Experimental, sandboxed environments | Minimal persistence |\n| **ironclaw** | Moderate | Security‑focused deployments with stricter sandboxing |\n| **picoclaw** | Very small | Edge devices or constrained hardware |\n\nChoosing the right variant depends on the hardware you plan to run on. For a Mac Mini, **NanoClaw** or **picoclaw** are the most feasible, but even these benefit from the robust supervision offered by cloud platforms.\n\n---\n\n## Further Reading & Resources\n- **Accessories & Upgrades for Your OpenClaw Mac Mini (2026)** – Practical hardware add‑ons such as locks, trackers, and external SSDs [OpenClaw Mac Mini Accessories & Upgrades](https://openclawn.com/openclaw-mac-mini-accessories-upgrades/)\n- **The Ultimate Guide to OpenClaw Mac Mini Docks & Hubs (2026)** – Recommendations for connectivity and peripheral expansion [OpenClaw Mac Mini Docks & Hubs Guide](https://openclawn.com/openclaw-mac-mini-docks-hubs-guide/)\n\n---\n\n*This section was added to address the recent feedback requesting explicit hardware compatibility information and a dedicated Mac Mini limitation overview.*",
